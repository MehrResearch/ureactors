Low-level access to RP2040 hardware registers in Micropython using uctypes

## What's it good for?
The Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller powers a range of versatile and very powerful development boards, including the [Raspberry Pi Pico] and the [Pimoroni Tiny 2040].The RP2040 Python SDK doesn't cover the chip's full hardware capabilities. Direct register access using the modules in this package allows full control of RP2040's low-level operations using Micropython.

## Status
The following shows progress towards bindings for all documented RP2040 registers, with [datasheet] sections shown in brackets. Please feel free to contribute new bindings or open an issue/submit a PR if you find any bugs.
